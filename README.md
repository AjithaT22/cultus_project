code project description
🚀 Project Overview

Time-series forecasting is essential in domains like finance, sensor analysis, weather prediction, and energy systems.
Traditional LSTM networks capture temporal dependencies but treat all timesteps equally.
To improve interpretability and accuracy, we add a Simple Attention layer that learns to focus on the most relevant timesteps.

This project includes:

Synthetic 3-feature time-series dataset generation

Preprocessing using MinMaxScaler

Custom Attention Layer

LSTM + Attention forecasting model

Baseline LSTM model

Prediction visualization

Evaluation using RMSE and MAE
